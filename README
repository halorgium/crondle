This is a dsl for making crontab code that ive been hacking for fun. Ill probably
make it into a gem at some stage.

Below is an example ruby file that uses crondle.

    require 'requires'

    Cron::Builder.define_jobs do |builder|

      builder.desc "Restart god every midnight"
      builder.job "/home/admin/bin/god-restart", :minute => 0,
                                                 :hour => 0

      builder.desc "Do an ls at 00:30 on the 5th day of every month"
      builder.job "ls", :minute => 30,
                        :hour => 0,
                        :day_of_month => 5

      builder.desc "Do a foobar every tuesday at midnight"
      builder.job "foobar", :day_of_week => :tuesday,
                        :hour => 0,
                        :minute => 0

      builder.desc "Run rodney at midnight nightly"
      builder.daily_job "rodney"

      builder.desc "Run boner at 3am nightly"
      builder.daily_job "boner", 3
    end



Running ruby on this file would produce the following crontab code


# Restart god every midnight
0 0 * * * /home/admin/bin/god-restart

# Do an ls at 00:30 on the 5th day of every month
30 0 5 * * ls

# Do a foobar every tuesday at midnight
0 0 * * 2 foobar

# Run rodney at midnight nightly
0 0 * * * rodney

# Run boner at 3am nightly
0 3 * * * boner
